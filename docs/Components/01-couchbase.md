# Couchbase

## Prerequisites

### 1. Docker Image

```shell  
 docker buildx imagetools create couchbase/server:latest --tag YOUR_REGISTRY/couchbase/server:latest
```

### 2. Library

=== "Gradle"

    ``` kotlin
        dependencies {
            testImplementation("com.trendyol:stove-testing-e2e-couchbase:$version")
        }
    ```

## Configure

After getting the library from the maven source, while configuring TestSystem you will have access to `withCouchbase` function.
This function configures the Couchbase Docker container that is going to be started.

Here you can define a `defaultBucket` name. 

!!! warning
    Make sure that your application has the same bucket names.

```kotlin
TestSystem()
    .withCouchbase(
        CouchbaseSystemOptions(defaultBucket = "test-bucket", configureExposedConfiguration = { cfg ->
            listOf(
                "couchbase.hosts=${cfg.hostsWithPort}",
                "couchbase.username=${cfg.username}",
                "couchbase.password=${cfg.password}"
            )
        })
    )
    .run()
```

Stove exposes configuration that is generated by the execution,
so you can pass the real connection strings and configurations to your Spring application before it starts.
Your application will start with the physical dependencies that are spun-up by the framework.

## Migrations

Stove provides a way to run migrations before the test starts.
