So you have a control over dependencies via Kotlin code.</p> <p>In the JVM world, thanks to code interoperability, you application code and test can be written with different JVM languages and can be run together. For example, you can write your application code with Java and write your tests with Kotlin, or Application code with Scala and test with Kotlin, etc. Stove uses this ability and provides a way to write your tests in Kotlin.</p> <p>Your tests will be infra agnostic, but component aware, so they can use easily necessary physical components with Stove provided APIs. All the infra is pluggable, and can be added easily. You can also create your own infra needs by using the abstractions that Stove provides. Having said that, the only dependency is <code>docker</code> since Stove is using testcontainers underlying.</p> <p>You can use JUnit and Kotest for running the tests.
